# IMPORTANT: Data files pushed to GitHub repositories are immediately public. 
# You should not be pushing unpublished data to the repository prior to your 
# publication date. You should use dummy data or already-published data during
# development of your dashboard.

# In order to help prevent unpublished data being accidentally published, the 
# template will not let you make a commit if there are unidentified csv, xlsx, 
# tex or pdf files contained in your repository. To make a commit, you will need 
# to either add the file to .gitignore or add an entry for the file into 
# datafiles_log.csv.
